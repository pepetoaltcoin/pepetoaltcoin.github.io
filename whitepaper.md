# 🐾 Pepeto Altcoin – Whitepaper

## 📄 Abstract
Pepeto Altcoin is a community-driven memecoin designed to combine the viral appeal of meme culture with the stability of transparent tokenomics. Built on the Solana blockchain, Pepeto aims to become more than just a meme — it’s a long-term project with structured vesting, fair allocations, and deflationary mechanics.  

The vision is simple: **a fun token that grows with the community while remaining sustainable over time.**

## 🌍 Vision
While many memecoins launch and collapse quickly, Pepeto Altcoin is designed for longevity. Through a fixed supply, responsible liquidity lock, and a vesting schedule for the team, Pepeto creates trust and aligns incentives for holders, developers, and investors.
